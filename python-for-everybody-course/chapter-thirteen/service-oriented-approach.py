#Service Oriented Approach
'''
* Most non-trival web applications user services
* They use services from other applications
 * Credit Card Charge
 * Hotel Reservation Systems
* Services publish the "rules" applications must follow to make use of the service (API)
'''

#Multiple Systems
'''
* Initially - two systems cooperate and split the problem
* As the data/service becomes useful-multiple applications want to use the information / application
